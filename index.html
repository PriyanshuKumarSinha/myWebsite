        <span>About</span>
        <p>
            Hey! I am Priyanshu from Jharkhand, India. I am a student and a self - taught web designer cum developer 
            and a struggler. I have been learning programming since 4 years now but same as every kid i didn't actually learned anything 
            for like 2 years but i was not a waste as it taught me how to actually learn programming. If have a blog of this story
            <a href = "">Here</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But after these 2 years of not so much learning i made a website with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap (<a href= "priyanshukumarsinha.netlify.app">priyanshukumarsinha. netlify. app</a>) .
            Now i was in Class XIth and i had python in my syllabus so i learned it all in like 2 months and got a little good at it.
            I remember i used to code scripts for 5-6 hours for some small tasks which could have been done in 5 to 10 minutes.
            But it was fun. In this year i learned a lot, like, python, OOP concepts, there was something like advanced python 
            where i learned to create dynamic websites with django then i learned heroku and github. While learning all this i
            got to know about LCO and hitesh sir. I baught his MERN course and then i got to know about JavaScript. I tried learning
            it for a while, it was fun, but i got bored and left it. Now when i got into Class XIIth, I had thaught of not learning 
            anything new this year and to focus on studies but everything go ruined due to COVID-19 and somehow i started learning 
            JavaScript again. But this time i didn't got bored. I completed JS course from Clever Qazi's 7 hours Youtube Video
            Tutorial, made all those projects and then learned canvas and let me tell you i felt like this was the best thing i had ever done
            . I learned creating Animation and Interaction with User using canvas and Javascript. I made some projects with it and 
            hosted in on github and netlify. I learned a lot during making of these projects and the final result of each
            project was just so good. 
       
        </p>
        <p>
            So after all these years, i had learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python and a little C# (since i wanted to learn Unity 
            but my laptop didn't liked that and kept crashing). Since i have learned a little more over these year i decided to update my website
            But somehow i had deleted that github repository so I created an another repository and here it is (don't forget to tell me
            about your reviews).
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank You :)
